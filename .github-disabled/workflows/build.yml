# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

# name: CI

# # Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# # events but only for the dev branch
# on:
#   push:
#     branches: [feature/deploy-setup]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [dev]

# # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# jobs:
#   # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
#   build:
#     # The type of runner that the job will run on
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

#     # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
#     steps:
#       # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v2

#       # Setup Java environment in order to build the Android app.
#       - uses: actions/setup-java@v1
